===============

Project done for Data Structures in C++. Reads in a file of bibliographic data and stores it. 

Name: Catherine Thomas

Professor: Dr. Hougen

To run, simply start the application then input the name of a .txt file with a list of bibliographic entries to be stored. 
The two .txt files currently in the project are 'ProjectConformantBibFile.bib.txt' and 'ShortBibFile.bib.txt'.
After the bib file is loaded, the user can simply follow the given prompts to do actions on it. 

NOTE: When loading a LARGE list of biliographic entries, my program will take approximately 30 seconds to fully
load it. It IS working, however.
